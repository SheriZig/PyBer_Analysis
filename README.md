# PyBer Ride Sharing Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis 
The purpose of the PyBer Ride Sharing analysis is to provide recommendations to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine the affordability for underserved neighborhoods. To accomplish the objectives, an analysis will be conducted utilizing summary data and visualizations.

Based on the summary data and visualization of ride sharing data, the following observations can be made: 

* Rural areas have fewer rides but the average fare per ride is significantly greater than for Urban areas.
* The trend for each of the city types (Urban, Suburban, Rural) continue throughout the time frame analyzed. The Urban areas consistantly generate the highest fares with Rural areas consistantly generating the lowest. 
* Total Drivers is nearly 2 times the number of Total Rides for the Urban areas.  The driver count per total rides decreases for Suburban and Rural areas.  
* Although the total fares for Urban areas is greater, the average fare per driver is significantly lower than for the Rural drivers. 
## Summary 
It would be helpful to evaluate the distance of each ride in the Rural areas. If the fare is based on the distance traveled, the residents of rural areas are at a clear disadvantage to utilize ride sharing services. To enhance accessability for rural residents, it may be helpful to offer ride sharing during speciic timeframes so that residents may share the rides and split the fare. 

Also, an evaluation of the population will provide data to determine the percent of the population who are utiliing ride sharing services. Rural areas are generally sparsely populated so accessibility and utilization may remain low. 

Noting that the average fare per driver in Rural areas is greater than in Urban areas, it may be beneficial to allocate greater resources to the Rural areas. Increasing the number of drivers available in the Rural areas may encourage increased participation while at the same time ensuring a greater average fare for the drivers.
